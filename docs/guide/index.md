# Why Vue-floating-dock?

This component was developed to serve as a customizable floating panel, inspired by Nuxt Devtools and Vue Devtools. It provides a structure without predefined styling, allowing you to fully adapt it to your specific needs.

All credits go to the developers of Nuxt Devtools and Vue Devtools, as this component draws significant inspiration from their work, with much of the code ported from these tools. Additionally, thanks to the developers of radix-vue for their innovative approach to componentization, which influenced the design of this library.
